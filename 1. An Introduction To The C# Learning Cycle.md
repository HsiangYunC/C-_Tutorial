(4 steps cycle)  
###  1. Watch toturial or read about something
###  2. Build about 2 to 5 practice projects
  - not real applications
  - just something to understand how that piece works
###  3. See how each piece fits into a large whole
  - real application
  - not only a theory
###  4. Take what you learned in the toturial into a real application
